File Descriptions:
- ADS1015.py: starts node for ADC convertor that samples the high G accel
- LSM9DS0.py: starts node for IMU. Only using 6DOF
- gps_node.py: start node for communicating with Adafruit Ultimate GPS
- commander.py: performs position estimation and determines apogee
- deployment.py: wrapper for sending a HIGH signal to the deployment board.
- save_data_node.py: logs the specified data streams.

TODO:
- LSM9DS0 seems to have an issue with writing control registers
  From an ID stand point, connections are okay
- ASD1015 crashed suddenly. Unexplained
- Write the position estimation.
